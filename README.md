## Playing with Axes
###   1.	Move the x-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the x-axis assembly.
###   2.	Move the y-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the y-axis assembly.
###   3.	Move the z-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z-axis assembly.

#### SMOOTH ROD :
It is guide rail component made up of hardened-steel or chrome plated steel .it smoothness ensures precise and consistent movement which is needed to produce accurate and high quality models
#### BEARING :
Linear bearings are typically used in conjunction with smooth rods,they are used to reduce friction . linear motion and rotational motion-ball bearing
#### IDLER :
The idler pulley helps to guide the belt along its path, reducing the chances of the belt slipping or jumping teeth and causing print defects.
#### EXTRUDER :
Extruder is used to melting and extruding the filament onto the print bed
#### MOTOR :
Motor is help to movement of the print head along x,y,z axes.
### Y-Axis Assembly :

#### Y AXIS SUPPORTER :
The Y-axis supporter must be designed to withstand the forces generated during printing and maintain the printer's accuracy and stability.
#### Horizontal & Vertical Threaded Rod :
The horizontal threaded rod is typically used to hold the pulley that drives the movement of the print bed along the Y-axis.The vertical threaded rod is typically used to control the Z-axis movement of the print bed.
#### SMOOTH ROD :
The use of smooth rods in the printer's Y-axis mechanism helps to provide smooth and precise movement of the print bed
#### PULLEY :
Pulley is often used in the Y-axis mechanism to transfer motion from the printer's stepper motor to the print bed.
#### MOTOR :
Motor is help to movement of the print head along x,y,z axes
#### Y AXIS FRAME :
It is responsible for support and stability of y axis frame.and also z axis.
#### Y AXIS BASE :
The Y-axis base is responsible for providing stability and support to the entire printer's structure, including the Y-axis frame, the print bed, and the printed object.
### Z-Axis Assembly :

#### Z AXIS ROD :
The z-axis rod is responsible for supporting the weight of the print head and controlling its movement as it moves up and down during the printing process
#### Z AXIS TOP COVER :
The primary purpose of the z-axis top cover is to prevent dust and debris from settling on the z-axis rod, which can cause damage to the rod and the bearings that guide it
#### MOTOR :
Motor is help to movement of the print head along x,y,z axes.

#### FRAME :
Rigid structure that holds all the other components of the printer.
#### Y AXIS ASSEMBLY :
The Y-axis is responsible for moving the print bed back and forth along the horizontal axis.
#### Z AXIS ASSEMBLY :
The Z-axis is responsible for moving the print head up and down along the vertical axis.
